The aim of thi app is to manage data coming from a wireless open source pulsoximeter device that I developed.

In this app you can pair the pulseoximeter with the Bluetooth.
I used a HC-05/SPP-c Bluetooth module.

To understand the Arduino code that I used check out my Arduino repository https://github.com/zamathebest/Arduino 

I used a Firebase database to store the information that the patient want to put.

If you have an Arduino and a HC05 you can try the app simulating a PPG signal with Matlab as I made to test the functionalities.
